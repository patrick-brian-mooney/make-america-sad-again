Word is I am doing very well in Michigan and Mississippi! Wow, and with all that money spent against me! Will be going to Trump Jupiter now!
Thank you Mississippi! #Trump2016
Thank you Michigan! #Trump2016
This was a great evening- I would like to thank everyone for their wonderful support.
Thank you Hawaii! #Trump2016
Phony Club For Growth tried to shake me down for one million dollars, & is now putting out nasty negative ads on me. They are total losers!
I just got off the phone with the great people of Guam! Thank you for your support! #VoteTrump today! #Trump2016
The organized group of people, many of them thugs, who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago, have totally energized America!
Absentee Governor Kasich voted for NAFTA and NAFTA devastated Ohio - a disaster from which it never recovered. Kasich is good for Mexico!
Ohio had the biggest budget increase in the U․S․. If it were not for striking oil, they would be bust! Governor Kasich in favor of TPP fraud!
The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled. Will be great - love you Ohio!
On my way to Dayton, Ohio. Will be there soon!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
Word is-early voting in FL is very dishonest. Little Marco, his State Chairman, & their minions are working overtime-trying to rig the vote.
We are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in Florida- on behalf of little Marco Rubio. No way to run a country!
The last person that Hillary or Bernie want to run against is Donald Trump --- and that is fact!
It is Clinton and Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago - and then they say I must talk to my people. Phony politicians!
Do the people of Ohio know that John Kasich is STRONGLY in favor of Common Core! In other words, education of your children from D․C․. No way
Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours!
Ohio Gov․Kasich voted for NAFTA, from which Ohio has never recovered. Now he wants TPP, which will be even worse. Ohio steel and coal dying!
Because Gov․ Kasich cannot run in the state of Pennsylvania-he cannot win the nomination- & should not be allowed to compete in Ohio on Tue.
Look forward to being in Tampa this afternoon. Wonderful crowds. Thank you, Florida!
Leaving the great people of North Carolina. Amazing event. Heading to Tampa now! #VoteTrump
Gov Kasich voted for NAFTA, which devastated Ohio and is now pushing TPP hard- bad for American workers!
Kasich has helped decimate the coal and steel industries in Ohio. I will bring them back! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Kasich voted for NAFTA, a disaster for Ohio, and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness!
Rubio is weak on illegal immigration, with the worst voting record in the U․S․. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I will bring our jobs back to America, fix our military and take care of our vets, end Common Core and ObamaCare, protect 2nd A, build WALL
Please remember, I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists!
Don't reward Mitt Romney, who let us all down in the last presidential race, by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA, open borders etc.).
Just in, big news- I have been declared the winner of the CNMI Rep Caucus with 72.8% of the vote! Thank you! #SuperTuesday #VoteTrump
Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico, now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now!
In presidential voting so far, John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him, I will beat Hillary!
I will bring our jobs back to the U․S․, and keep our companies from leaving. Nobody else can do it. Our economy will "sing" again.
A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida? Hope this is false.
Word is that, despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads, I had a massive victory in Florida. Numbers out soon!
Can't watch Crazy Megyn anymore. Talks about me at 43% but never mentions that there are four people in race. With two people, big & over!
I only wish my wonderful daughter Tiffany could have been with us at Mar-a-Lago for our great election victory. She is a winner!
Yesterday was amazing—5 victories. Lyin’ Ted Cruz had zero. Things are going very well!
In the last 2 weeks, I had $35M of negative ads against me in Florida & I won in a massive landslide.The establishment should save their $$!
Thank you to the Governor of Florida, Rick Scott, for your endorsement. I greatly appreciate your support!
Stuart Stevens, the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romney's historic loss, is now telling the Republican Party what to do with Trump. Sad!
The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem!
Looking like my 5 victories on Tuesday will be just as good as if I won Ohio. Two more days and Ohio was mine!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Hillary Clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life!
Lyin' Ted Cruz lost all five races on Tuesday-and he was just given the jinx - a Lindsey Graham endorsement. Also backed Jeb. Lindsey got 0!
With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment, my numbers continue to go up. Can anyone explain this?
Club For Growth tried to extort $1,000,000 from me. When I said NO, they went hostile with negative ads. Disgraceful!
Going to Salt Lake City, Utah, for a big rally. Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there - Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary
Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the man who "choked" and let us all down, is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me!
Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich & Marco Rubio, and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz. 1/2
Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost!
Do you believe that Hillary Clinton now wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants? She should spend more time taking care of our great Vets!
Why haven't they released the final Missouri victory for us yet? Could it be because Cruz's guy runs Missouri?
Just leaving Salt Lake City, Utah- fantastic crowd with no interruptions. Love Utah- will be back!
Heading to Phoneix. Will be arriving soon. Tomorrow a big day. Tremendous crowds expected! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Landing in Phoenix now. Tomorrow's events will be amazing! #Trump2016
The rallies in Utah and Arizona were great! Tremendous crowds and spirit. Just returned but will be going back soon.
Why is it that the horrendous protesters, who scream, curse punch, shut down roads/doors during my RALLIES, are never blamed by media? SAD!
The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday, delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours, and the media blames my supporters!
Big Republican Dinner tonight at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. I will be there!
Wow, President Obama just landed in Cuba, a big deal, and Raul Castro wasn't even there to greet him. He greeted Pope and others. No respect
Do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was. Not anymore, it is from a different world! U․S․ must be vigilant and smart!
President Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba, especially in the shadows of Brussels. He is being treated badly!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
My heart & prayers go out to all of the victims of the terrible #Brussels tragedy. This madness must be stopped, and I will stop it.
Obama, and all others, have been so weak, and so politically correct, that terror groups are forming and getting stronger! Shame.
Pres․ Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately & get home to Washington- where a #POTUS, under a serious emergency belongs!
Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G․Q․ shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!
Incompetent Hillary, despite the horrible attack in Brussels today, wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in. No way!
Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you, I will never forget!
Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November, paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices!
Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G․Q․ model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted!
Lyin’ Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me, and lines from Michael Douglas— just another dishonest politician.
Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates, Lyin’ Ted Cruz. Honestly, I can’t blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion!
Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. She’s been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are!
I will be the best by far in fighting terror. I’m the only one that was right from the beginning, & now Lyin’ Ted & others are copying me.
I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted. Jeb spent more than $150,000,000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first!
While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates, it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
N.A․T․O․ is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!
We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N․A․T․O․. Why? It is time to renegotiate, and the time is now!
These politicians like Cruz and Graham, who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years, do nothing to make things better!
It is amazing how often I am right, only to be criticized by the media. Illegal immigration, take the oil, build the wall, Muslims, NATO!
Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE, I WILL SOLVE - AND FAST!
Just announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe. Also, many in U․S․ I TOLD YOU SO! I alone can fix this problem!
Europe and the U․S․ must immediately stop taking in people from Syria. This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it! So sad!
Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it. If I lost-monster story!
I didn't start the fight with Lyin'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania, he did. He knew the PAC was putting it out - hence, Lyin' Ted!
Wow, just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me. How am I still number one - by a lot?
Top suspect in Paris massacre, Salah Abdeslam, who also knew of the Brussels attack, is no longer talking. Weak leaders, ridiculous laws!
The media is so after me on women Wow, this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump!
The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women, when they know that it is just the opposite!
Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me. I had NOTHING to do with story!
Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J․ Trump. Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out!
Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U․S․, jobs are leaving. I will make our economy strong again - bring in jobs
Remember, I am the only candidate who is self-funding. While I am given little credit for this by the voters, I am not bought like others!
My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the U․S․ are now, finally, receiving plaudits!
Happy Easter to all, have a great day!
Another radical Islamic attack, this time in Pakistan, targeting Christian women & children. At least 67 dead,400 injured. I alone can solve
Why can't the pundits be honest? Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again. I will make it strong and great! JOBS!
Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be, I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming
The United States cannot continue to make such bad, one-sided trade deals. There are only so many jobs we can give up. No more!
A detainee released from Gitmo has killed an American. When will our so-called "leaders" ever learn!
Ted Cruz is incensed that I want to refocus NATO on terrorism, as well as current mission, but also want others to PAY FAIR SHARE, a must!
Just released that international gangs are all over our cities. This will end when I am President!
After the way I beat Gov․ Scott Walker (and Jeb, Rand, Marco and all others) in the Presidential Primaries, no way he would ever endorse me!
Lyin'Ted Cruz is weak & losing big, so now he wants to debate again. But, according to Drudge,Time and on-line polls, I have won all debates
Lyin' Ted, I have already beaten you in all debates, and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. You should focus on jobs & illegal imm!
We need to secure our borders ASAP. No games, we must be smart, tough and vigilant. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN & MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN!
I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich, and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC.
Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!
Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened, that is before she found out the episode was on tape?
The Club For Growth,which asked me for $1,000,000 in an extortion attempt, just put up a Wisconsin ad with incorrect math.What a dumb group!
The Club For Growth said in their ad that 465 delegates (Cruz) plus 143 delegates (Kasich) is more than my 739 delegates. Try again!
The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) said that our open border is the biggest physical & economic threat facing the American people!
For the 1st time in American history, America’s 16,500 border patrol agents have issue a presidential primary endorsement—me! Thank you.
Can you believe that Ted Cruz, who has been killing our country on trade for so long, just put out a Wisconsin ad talking about trade?
I will be in Wisconsin until the election. Jobs, trade and immigration will be big factors. I will bring jobs back home - make great deals!
Wisconsin has suffered a great loss of jobs and trade, but if I win, all of the bad things happening in the U․S․ will be rapidly reversed!
A great day in Wisconsin, many stops, many great people! Melania is joining me on Monday. Big crowds. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
This Tweet from @realDonaldTrump has been withheld in response to a report from the copyright holder.
Wisconsin, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
It is so great to be back home! Looking forward to a great rally tonight in Bethpage, Long Island!
Unbelievable evening. Just made a speech in front 17,000 amazing New Yorkers in Bethpage, Long Island--- great to be home!
So great to be in New York. Catching up on many things (remember, I am still running a major business while I campaign) and loving it!
Isn't it a shame that the person who will have by far the most delegates and many millions more votes than anyone else, me, still must fight
Bernie Sanders says that Hillary Clinton is unqualified to be president. Based on her decision making ability, I can go along with that!
I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign. Bad system!
How is it possible that the people of the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary? Great anger - totally unfair!
The people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians. Biggest story in politics. This will not be allowed!
Leaving for Albany, New York now, massive crowd expected. Very exciting!
Biggest story in politics is now happening in the great State of Colorado where over one million people have been precluded from voting!
The rules DID CHANGE in Colorado shortly after I entered the race in June because the pols and their bosses knew I would win with the voters
Big protest march in Colorado on Friday afternoon! Don't let the bosses take your vote!
I'll be in one of my favorite places this morning, Staten Island. Big crowd, will be fun!
Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system, I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him.
Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work!
Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesn't want to run against. Will be such fun!
I would have millions of votes more than Hillary except for the fact that I had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named Bernie!
Lyin' Ted Cruz can't win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses-I am millions of VOTES ahead! Hillary would destroy him & K
Kasich only looks O․K․ in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him
Lyin’ Ted Cruz even voted against Superstorm Sandy aid and September 11th help. So many New Yorkers devastated. Cruz hates New York!
A big day for New York and for our COUNTRY! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Thank you New York, I will never forget!
Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race. Now all he can do is be a spoiler, never a nice thing to do. I will beat Hillary!
We are going to bring steel and manufacturing back to Indiana!
Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!
Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!
Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted.
I met Prince on numerous occasions. He was an amazing talent and wonderful guy. He will be greatly missed!
Will be spending the day campaigning in Connecticut, another state where jobs are being stolen by other countries. I will stop this fast!
I had a great day campaigning in Connecticut. Looking for a big vote on Tuesday!
As soon as John Kasich is hit with negative ads, he will drop like a rock in the polls against Crooked Hillary Clinton. I will win!
I will be in Maryland this afternoon for a major rally. Things are looking good for Tuesday!
Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!
Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!
Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!
Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.
Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work.
On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night!
The Cruz-Kasich pact is under great strain. This joke of a deal is falling apart, not being honored and almost dead. Very dumb!
Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats—both with delegates & otherwise. He should show them, and run as an Independent!
How bad is the New York Times—the most inaccurate coverage constantly. Always trying to belittle. Paper has lost its way!
I am in Indiana where we just had a great rally. Fantastic people! Staying at a Holiday Inn Express - new and clean, not bad!
Getting the strong endorsement of the great coach, Bobby Knight, has been a highlight of my stay in Indiana. Big speech tomorrow with Bobby!
Thank you to all for the wonderful reviews of my foreign policy speech. I will soon be speaking in great detail on numerous other topics!
Lyin' Ted Cruz, who can never beat Hillary Clinton and has NO path to victory, has chosen a V․P․candidate who failed badly in her own effort
I will be in Evansville, Indiana, with the great Bobby Knight (who last night endorsed me) at 12:00 this afternoon. See you there!
So many false and phony T․V․ commercials being broadcast in Indiana. Reminds me of Florida where thousands were put up-I won in a landslide!
Wow, the ridiculous deal made between Lyin'Ted Cruz and 1 for 42 John Kasich has just blown up. What a dumb deal - dead on arrival!
Crooked Hillary Clinton, perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency, is also one of the all time great enablers!
We are now at 1001 delegates. We will win on the first ballot and are not wasting time and effort on other ballots because system is rigged!
The "protesters" in California were thugs and criminals. Many are professionals. They should be dealt with strongly by law enforcement!
The economy is bad and getting worse-almost ZERO growth this quarter. Nobody can beat me on the economy (and jobs). MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
I will be in Indiana on Sunday and Monday at four MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN rallies. See you there!
Will be in Terre Haute, Indiana in a short while -- big rally! See you soon!
Crooked Hillary Clinton said she is used to "dealing with men who get off the reservation." Actually, she has done poorly with such men!
Gov Mike Pence has just stated that Donald Trump has taken a strong stance on Hoosier jobs, and he thanks me! I will bring back jobs to USA.
Everybody is talking about the protesters burning the American flags and proudly waving Mexican flags. I want America First - so do voters!
I will be campaigning in Indiana all day. Things are looking great, and the support of Bobby Knight has been so amazing. Today will be fun!
Will be in South Bend, Indiana in a short while -- big rally! See you soon!
Wow, Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad!
Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will, and must, win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time & money
Thank you Indiana, we were just projected to be the winner. We have won in every category. You are very special people-I will never forget!
What a great evening we had. So interesting that Sanders beat Crooked Hillary. The dysfunctional system is totally rigged against him!
I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie!
Many reports that I will be attending the Alvarez/Khan fight this weekend in Vegas. Totally untrue! Unfortunately I have other plans.
Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats—both with delegates & otherwise. He should show them, & run as an Independent.
Can you believe Crooked Hillary said, "We are going to put a whole lot of coal miners&coal companies out of business." She then apologized.
Thank you West Virginia. Let's keep it going. Go out and vote on Tuesday - we will win big. #Trump2016
Unlike crooked Hillary Clinton, who wants to destroy all miners, I want wages to go up in America. We will do so by bringing back jobs!
Governor Rick Perry said "Donald Trump is one of the most talented people running for the Presidency I've ever seen." Thank you Rick!
So many great endorsements yesterday, except for Paul Ryan! We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party. Wrong, I didn't inherit it, I won it with millions of voters!
Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says, she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad!
Thank you to teachers across America! When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now.
Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed, then John Kasich and that didn't work. Not much power or insight!
I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.
Let’s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren’s records to see if she is Native American. I say she’s a fraud!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton’s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.
Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy.
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.
Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.
Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk, no action -- maybe her Native American name?
Remember when the two failed presidential candidates, Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush, signed a binding PLEDGE? They broke the deal, no honor!
I will be interviewed on This Week with George S this morning. Enjoy!
Crooked Hillary just can't close the deal with Bernie. It will be the same way with ISIS, and China on trade, and Mexico at the border. Bad!
I will win the election against Crooked Hillary despite the people in the Republican Party that are currently and selfishly opposed to me!
Crooked Hillary Clinton says that she got more primary votes than Donald Trump. But I had 17 people to beat—she had one!
If I only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like Hillary Clinton, I would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did!
I will have set the all time record in primary votes in the Republican party --despite having to compete against 17 other people!
I am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate. Any negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current!
Get out and vote West Virginia, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Get out and vote Nebraska, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Why does the media, with a strong push from Crooked Hillary, keep pushing the false narrative that I want to raise taxes. Exactly opposite!
It is only the people that were never asked to be VP that tell the press that they will not take the position.
I look very much forward to meeting w/Paul Ryan & the GOP Party Leadership on Thurs in DC. Together, we will beat the Dems at all levels!
It was so great being in Nebraska last week. Today is the big day--get out and vote!
The Clintons spend millions on negative ads on me & I can’t tell the truth about her husband? Don’t feel sorry for crooked Hillary!
Big wins in West Virginia and Nebraska. Get ready for November - Crooked Hillary, who is looking very bad against Crazy Bernie, will lose!
I don't want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary. His time will come!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U․S․. Senate. She has done nothing!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren didn’t have the guts to run for POTUS. Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold.
If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been, she would lose!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the woman’s card like her friend crooked Hillary. See her dumb tweet “when a woman stands up to you…”
Our Native American Senator, goofy Elizabeth Warren, couldn’t care less about the American worker…does nothing to help!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage. See media—asking for increase!
Isn’t it funny when a failed Senator like goofy Elizabeth Warren can spend a whole day tweeting about Trump & gets nothing done in Senate?
If it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren, we’d have no jobs in America—she doesn’t have a clue.
Senator Lindsey Graham called me yesterday, very much to my surprise, and we had a very interesting talk about national security, and more!
If Crooked Hillary Clinton can't close the deal on Crazy Bernie, how is she going to take on China, Russia, ISIS and all of the others?
The media is really on a witch-hunt against me. False reporting, and plenty of it - but we will prevail!
Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems. The system is rigged against him. He should run as an independent! Run Bernie, run.
"In politics, and in life, ignorance is not a virtue." This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in U․S․ history!
I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N․Y․ construction job, when that was unheard of, and now she is nasty. So much for a nice thank you!
What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly, and for years, trying to come back. I said no.
Wow, 30,000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?
The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. "You can tell them to go BLANK themselves" - was about China, NOT WOMEN!
Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women. Can't believe she would misrepresent the facts! My hit was on China
Oregon is voting today. Keep the big numbers going - VOTE TRUMP! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U․S․ political history
Crooked Hillary can't close the deal with Bernie Sanders. Will be another bad day for her!
Crooked Hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy.If so, he should run,not her.Will he bring the "energizer" to D․C․?
How can Crooked Hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for NAFTA, the worst economic deal in U․S․ history?
Do you think Crooked Hillary will finally close the deal? If she can't win Kentucky, she should drop out of race. System rigged!
Wall Street paid for ad is a fraud, just like Crooked Hillary! Their main line had nothing to do with women, and they knew it. Apologize?
I like Michael Douglas!
Will go back on for a final question now!
Well, that is it. Well done Megyn --- and they all lived happily ever after! Now let us all see how "THE MOVEMENT" does in Oregon tonight!
I look so forward to debating Crooked Hillary Clinton! Democrat Primaries are rigged, e-mail investigation is rigged - so time to get it on!
Congratulations to THE MOVEMENT, we have just won THE GREAT STATE OF OREGON. The vote percentage is even higher than anticipated! Thank you.
Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Democrats - the system is rigged against him. Many of his disenfranchised fans are for me!
My list of potential U․S․. Supreme Court Justices was very well recieved. During the next number of weeks I may be adding to the list!
Looks like yet another terrorist attack. Airplane departed from Paris. When will we get tough, smart and vigilant? Great hate and sickness!
I said that Crooked Hillary Clinton is "not qualified" to be president because she has "very bad judgement" - Bernie said the same thing!
Crooked Hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina. ISIS, China, Russia and all would love for her to be president. 4 more years!
Look where the world is today, a total mess, and ISIS is still running around wild. I can fix it fast, Hillary has no chance!
Crooked Hillary Clinton looks presidential? I don't think so! Four more years of Obama and our country will never come back. ISIS LAUGHS!
Crooked Hillary can't even close the deal with Bernie - and the Dems have it rigged in favor of Hillary. Four more years of this? No way!
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. No gun owner can ever vote for Clinton!
Crooked Hillary is spending tremendous amounts of Wall Street money on false ads against me. She is a very dishonest person!
While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day, the TSA is falling apart, just like our government! Airports a total disaster!
Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. No more guns to protect Hillary!
Crooked Hillary Clintons foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria, Iraq and Libya. She is reckless and dangerous!
Crooked Hillary said that I want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!
Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad! Would be four more years of stupidity!
Crooked Hillary wants a radical 500% increase in Syrian refugees. We can’t allow this. Time to get smart and protect America!
Bernie Sanders is continuing his quest because he believes that Crooked Hillary Clinton will be forced out of the race - e-mail scandal!
The American people are sick and tired of not being able to lead normal lives and to constantly be on the lookout for terror and terrorists!
In trade, military and EVERYTHING else, it will be AMERICA FIRST! This will quickly lead to our ultimate goal: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Obama’s VA Secretary just said we shouldn't measure wait times. Hillary says VA problems are not ‘widespread.’ I will take care of our vets!
While under no obligation to do so, I have raised between 5 & 6 million dollars, including 1million dollars from me, for our VETERANS. Nice!
Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed, with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups.
Amazingly, with all of the money I have raised for the vets, I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media.
I just released my financial disclosure forms, the largest numbers in the history of the F․E․C․. Even the dishonest media thinks great!
Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates, overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs. Most importantly, she suffers from plain old bad judgement!
Great rally in New Mexico, amazing crowd! Now in L․A․. Big rally in Anaheim.
Crooked Hillary Clinton just can't close the deal with Bernie. I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates. Hillary doesn't have it
The protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag. The rally inside was big and beautiful, but outside, criminals!
Thank you Washington! Honored to say, on behalf of our great movement, we have broken the all time record for votes in GOP primary history.
The Inspector General's report on Crooked Hillary Clinton is a disaster. Such bad judgement and temperament cannot be allowed in the W․H․
I find it offensive that Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, pretended to be Native American to get in Harvard.
The U․S․ has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. How nice, but what do we get? NOT ENOUGH
I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go! Thank you.
The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money & get much better results! What we need as Prez!
Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me!
Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he's in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. #MDW
Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country! We love them.
Heading to D․C․ to see and hear ROLLING THUNDER. Amazing people that LOVE OUR COUNTRY. Great spirit!
Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do.
Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser, but if the GOP can't control their own, then they are not a party. Be tough, R's!
The Republican Party has to be smart & strong if it wants to win in November. Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate!
If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent, say good bye to the Supreme Court!
Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W․H․
In getting the endorsement of the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you), the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary!
The endorsement of me by the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. Nice!
Have a great Memorial Day and remember that we will soon MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I would have had millions of votes more in the primaries (than Crooked Hillary) if I only had one opponent, instead of sixteen. Broke record
I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day!
I have a judge in the Trump University civil case, Gonzalo Curiel (San Diego), who is very unfair. An Obama pick. Totally biased-hates Trump
I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge, Gonzalo Curiel, who is totally biased against me.
So many great things happening - new poll numbers looking good! News conference at 11:00 A․M․ today, Trump Tower!
I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS, and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. Watch!
Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5,600,000 that I raised/gave!
So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raised/gave! It was my great honor - they do an amazing job.
Katie Couric, the third rate reporter, who has been largely forgotten, should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc.
I am getting great credit for my press conference today. Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days.
So I raised/gave $5,600,000 for the veterans and the media makes me look bad! They do anything to belittle - totally biased.
Crooked Hillary Clinton is a fraud who has put the public and country at risk by her illegal and very stupid use of e-mails. Many missing!
Crooked Hillary Clinton has zero natural talent - she should not be president. Her temperament is bad and her decision making ability-zilch!
Bernie Sanders was right when he said that Crooked Hillary Clinton was not qualified to be president because she suffers from BAD judgement!
Wow, USA Today did todays cover story on my record in lawsuits. Verdict: 450 wins, 38 losses. Isn't that what you want for your president?
With all of the Crooked Hillary Clinton's foreign policy experience, she has made so many mistakes - and I mean real monsters! No more HRC.
Even though I have a very biased and unfair judge in the Trump U civil case in San Diego, I have thousands of great reviews & will win case!
After the litigation is disposed of and the case won, I have instructed my execs to open Trump U(?), so much interest in it! I will be pres.
Crooked Hillary Clinton, who I would love to call Lyin' Hillary, is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions.
Crooked Hillary no longer has credibility - too much failure in office. People will not allow another four years of incompetence!
Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn't even look presidential!
So great to have the endorsement and support of Paul Ryan. We will both be working very hard to Make America Great Again!
A 60% increase in Texas Blue Cross/Blue Shield through ObamaCare. I told you so, there is panic and anger as healthcare costs explode!
Then, on June 25th- back to the USA to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Terrible jobs report just reported. Only 38,000 jobs added. Bombshell!
Rally last night in San Jose was great. Tremendous love and enthusiasm in the hall. Big crowd. Outside, small group of thugs burned Am flag!
In Crooked Hillary's telepromter speech yesterday, she made up things that I said or believe but have no basis in fact. Not honest!
Great evening in San Jose other than the thugs. My supporters are far tougher if they want to be, but fortunately they are not hostile.
Muhammad Ali is dead at 74! A truly great champion and a wonderful guy. He will be missed by all!
Many of the thugs that attacked the peaceful Trump supporters in San Jose were illegals. They burned the American flag and laughed at police
The Mayor of San Jose did a terrible job of ordering the protection of innocent people. The thugs were lucky supporters remained peaceful!
We just had the worst jobs report since 2010.
Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president. She has bad judgement, poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record. Change!
Just like I have been able to spend far less money than others on the campaign and finish #1, so too should our country. We can be great!
Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions!
Crooked Hillary is being badly criticized (for a Wall Street paid for ad) by PolitiFact for a false ad on me on women. She is a total fraud!
A massive blow to Obama's message - only 38,000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report. That's REALLY bad!
I am getting bad marks from certain pundits because I have a small campaign staff. But small is good, flexible, save money and number one!
A former Secret Service Agent for President Clinton excoriates Crooked Hillary describing her as ERRATIC & VIOLENT. Bad temperament for pres
In just out book, Secret Service Agent Gary Byrne doesn't believe that Crooked Hillary has the temperament or integrity to be the president!
I will be speaking about our great journey to the Republican nomination at 9:00 P․M․. The movement toward a country that WINS again continues
Thank you to all for your wonderful comments on my speech. I could feel the electricity in thr air. Great reviews - most votes ever recieved
I would have had many millions of votes more than Crooked Hillary Clinton except for the fact that I had 16 opponents, she had one!
Bernie Sanders must really dislike Crooked Hillary after the way she played him. Many of his supporters, because of trade, will come to me.
As expected, the media is very much against me. Their dishonesty is amazing but, just like our big wins in the primaries, we will win!
Crooked Hillary Clinton will be a disaster on jobs, the economy, trade, healthcare, the military, guns and just about all else. Obama plus!
Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of Obama—but nobody else does!
Pocahontas is at it again! Goofy Elizabeth Warren, one of the least productive U․S․. Senators, has a nasty mouth. Hope she is V․P․ choice.
The great boxing promoter, Don King, just endorsed me. Nice!
Heading to D․C․ to speak at Faith and Freedom Coalition and visit OPO.
Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist-but I am least racist person there is
Don King, and so many other African Americans who know me well and endorsed me, would not have done so if they thought I was a racist!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, pretended to be a Native American in order to advance her career. Very racist!
Really bad shooting in Orlando. Police investigating possible terrorism. Many people dead and wounded.
Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!
Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims & their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough, smart & vigilant?
Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!
Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!
Reporting that Orlando killer shouted "Allah hu Akbar!" as he slaughtered clubgoers. 2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade.
What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough
I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just broke-said she would now use!
I will be going to New Hampshire today, home of my first primary victory, to discuss terror and the horrible events of yesterday. 2:30 P․M․
In my speech on protecting America I spoke about a temporary ban, which includes suspending immigration from nations tied to Islamic terror.
American must now get very tough, very smart and very vigilant. We cannot admit people into our country without extraordinary screening.
AMERICA FIRST!
Thank you to the LGBT community! I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.
The press is so totally biased that we have no choice but to take our tough but fair and smart message directly to the people!
I will be meeting with the NRA, who has endorsed me, about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list, or the no fly list, to buy guns.
Amazing crowd last night in Dallas - more spirit and passion than ever before. Today, all over the great State of Texas!
People very unhappy with Crooked Hillary and Obama on JOBS and SAFETY! Biggest trade deficit in many years! More attacks will follow Orlando
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
In Las Vegas, getting ready to speak!
How can the NY Times show an empty room hours before my speech even started when they knew it was going to be packed? So totally dishonest!
When I said that if, within the Orlando club, you had some people with guns, I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees
Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament, according to new book, which is a mess!
I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Hillary says this election is about judgment. She's right. Her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy.
Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs.
How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk?
Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe.
I am "the king of debt."That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U․S․
Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays.
If you want to know about Hillary Clinton's honesty & judgment, ask the family of Ambassador Stevens.
Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State. She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt, dangerous, dishonest.
Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief! She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy!
Hillary says things can't change. I say they have to change. It's a choice between Americanism and her corrupt globalism. #Imwithyou
Thank you to Donald Rumsfeld for the endorsement. Very much appreciated. Clinton's conduct has been "disqualifying."
"Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency." -- Donald J․ Trump
ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama." -- Donald J․ Trump
Hillary Clinton’s open borders are tearing American families apart. I am going to make our country Safe Again for all Americans. #Imwithyou
Obama & Clinton should stop meeting with special interests, & start meeting with the victims of illegal immigration.
On immigration, I’m consulting with our immigration officers & our wage-earners. Hillary Clinton is consulting with Wall Street.
Our inner cities have been left behind. We will never have the resources to support our people if we have an open border.
Leaving now for a one night trip to Scotland in order to be at the Grand Opening of my great Turnberry Resort. Will be back on Sat. night!
Congratulations to my son, Eric, on the fantastic job he has done in rebuilding Turnberry, and its great Ailsa Course. Always support kids!
Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote. They took their country back, just like we will take America back. No games!
Getting ready to open the magnificent Turnberry in Scotland. What a great day, especially when added to the brave & brilliant vote.
Self-determination is the sacred right of all free people's, and the people of the UK have exercised that right for all the world to see.
America is proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder w/a free & ind UK. We stand together as friends, as allies, & as a people w/a shared history.
Crooked Hillary called it totally wrong on BREXIT - she went with Obama - and now she is saying we need her to lead. She would be a disaster
The opening of Trump Turnberry in Scotland was a big success. Good timing, I was here for BREXIT. Very exciting news conference today!
Many people are equating BREXIT, and what is going on in Great Britain, with what is happening in the U․S․. People want their country back!
Thoughts and prayers are with everyone in West Virginia- dealing with the devastating floods. #ImWithYou
So funny, Crooked Hillary called BREXIT so incorrectly, and now she says that she is the one to deal with the U․K․. All talk, no action!
We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place.
We only want to admit those who love our people and support our values. #AmericaFirst
I have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' -- but we must enforce the laws of the land!
Obama has blocked ICE officers and BP from doing their jobs. That ends when I am President!
Just landed in New York - a one night stay in Scotland. Turnberry came out magnificently. My son, Eric, did a great job - under budget!
George Will, one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago), has left the Republican Party.He's made many bad calls
Crooked Hillary Clinton, who called BREXIT 100% wrong (along with Obama), is now spending Wall Street money on an ad on my correct call.
Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads. Disgraceful!
Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry. Shows me hitting shot, but I never did = lie! Was there to support son
People in our country want borders, and without them the old line pols like Crooked Hillary will not win. It is time for CHANGE -- and JOBS!
Hillary Clinton is not a change agent, just the same old status quo! She is spending a fortune, I am spending very little. Close in polls!
Crooked Hillary Clinton got Brexit wrong. I said LEAVE will win. She has no sense of markets and such bad judgement. Only a question of time
Crooked Hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the U․S․. Senate, goofy Elizabeth Warren, who lied on heritage.
The media is unrelenting. They will only go with and report a story in a negative light. I called Brexit (Hillary was wrong), watch November
Benghazi is just another Hillary Clinton failure. It just never seems to work the way it's supposed to with Clinton.
Hillary Clinton’s Presidency would be catastrophic for the future of our country. She is ill-fit with bad judgment.
Yet another terrorist attack, this time in Turkey. Will the world ever realize what is going on? So sad.
We must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the United States.
Iron Mike Tyson was not asked to speak at the Convention though I'm sure he would do a good job if he was. The media makes everything up!
Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters?
ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!
Tremendous day in Massachusetts and Maine. Thank you to everyone for making it so special!
I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. I have totally terminated the loan!
The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple, I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!
Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.
Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?
Just returned from Colorado. Amazing crowd!
The speakers slots at the Republican Convention are totally filled, with a long waiting list of those that want to speak - Wednesday release
It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!
It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged!
Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U․S․A․G․ was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U․S․A․G․ to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged & corrupt!
On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!
"THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!"
Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U․S․A․G․ talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?
The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U․S․A․G․ in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away, no pictures."
I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U․S․A․G․. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!
In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!
The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad, worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!
Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change!
Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star, or plain star!
Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd, the end result was solid!
Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed, great people!
The only people who are not interested in being the V․P․ pick are the people who have not been asked!
Crooked Hillary Clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33,000 missing e-mails?
With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!
Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?
Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!
The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual, bad judgment.
FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem
Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win
I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "murder." Come November 8, she's out!
Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U․S․. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!
Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information." Not fit!
Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement.
Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch, her time will come!
I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies.
Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center, Airport - and destroyed City
Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A․C․. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.
Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again.He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N․C․
Convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow. Let today be devoted to Crooked Hillary and the rigged system under which we live.
Just leaving D․C․. Had great meetings with Republicans in the House and Senate. Very interesting day! These are people who love our country!
After today, Crooked Hillary can officially be called Lyin' Crooked Hillary.
Prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country
Due to the horrific events taking place in our country, I have decided to postpone my speech on economic opportunity- today in Miami.
Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton. We are a divided nation!
President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe!
The media is so dishonest. If I make a statement, they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.They think the public is stupid!
Thoughts and prayers with the victims, and their families- along with everyone at the Berrien County Courthouse in St. Joseph, Michigan.
Crime is out of control, and rapidly getting worse. Look what is going on in Chicago and our inner cities. Not good!
For too many years, our inner cities have been left behind. I am going to deliver jobs, safety and protection for those in need.
This election is a choice between law, order & safety - or chaos, crime & violence. I will make America safe again for everyone. #ImWithYou
Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!
I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out!
Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.
Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.
To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests, we welcome you with open arms. People first.
Justice Ginsburg of the U․S․. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot - resign!
New GOP platform now includes language that supports the border wall. We will build the wall and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
The Republican platform is most pro-Israel of all time!
Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves? Think about it and let me know!
Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.
On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others.
Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!
If I win the Presidency, we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions!
I will be making the announcement of my Vice Presidential pick on Friday at 11am in Manhattan. Details to follow.
I employ many people in the State of Virginia - JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! Crooked Hillary will sell us out, just like her husband did with NAFTA.
Another horrific attack, this time in Nice, France. Many dead and injured. When will we learn? It is only getting worse.
In light of the horrible attack in Nice, France, I have postponed tomorrow's news conference concerning my Vice Presidential announcement.
My prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the terrible tragedy in Nice, France. We are with you in every way!
#NeverTrump is never more. They were crushed last night in Cleveland at Rules Committee by a vote of 87-12. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Four more years of weakness with a Crooked Hillary Administration is not acceptable. Look what has happened to the world with O & Hillary!
I am pleased to announce that I have chosen Governor Mike Pence as my Vice Presidential running mate. News conference tomorrow at 11:00 A․M․
Look forward to Governor Mike Pence V․P․ introduction tomorrow in New York City.
Look forward to introducing Governor Mike Pence (who has done a spectacular job in the great State of Indiana). My first choice from start!
Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I don't have foreign policy experience, yet look what her policies have done
Crooked Hillary, who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies, has been a DISASTER on foreign policy. Look what's happening!
Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes, Crooked Hillary Clinton, can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money!
Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street, lobbyists and special interests. She will sell our country down the tubes!
Thank you to Chris Cox and Bikers for Trump - Your support has been amazing. I will never forget. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Thank you to Jack Morgan, Tamara Neo, Cheryl Ann Kraft and all of my friends and supporters in Virginia. GREAT JOB!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren, who may be the least productive Senator in the U․S․. Senate, must prove she is not a fraud. Without the con it's over
We are going to have a great time in Cleveland. Will lead to special results for our country. We will Make America Great Again!
As the days and weeks go by, we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions!
It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement!
I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, as her V․P․. Then we can litigate her fraud!
If Goofy Elizabeth Warren, a very weak Senator, didn't lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today. Pick her H
We are TRYING to fight ISIS, and now our own people are killing our police. Our country is divided and out of control. The world is watching
Our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching. We are not looking good, we are not looking smart, we are not looking tough!
President Obama just had a news conference, but he doesn't have a clue. Our country is a divided crime scene, and it will only get worse!
Looking forward to being at the convention tonight to watch all of the wonderful speakers including my wife, Melania. Place looks beautiful!
It was truly an honor to introduce my wife, Melania. Her speech and demeanor were absolutely incredible. Very proud! #GOPConvention
The ROLL CALL is beginning at the Republican National Convention. Very exciting!
Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States. I will work hard and never let you down! AMERICA FIRST!
Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. I am very proud of you!
In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!
Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!
The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails.
John Kasich was never asked by me to be V․P․. Just arrived in Cleveland - will be a great two days!
Watching the #GOPConvention #AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE
Wow, Ted Cruz got booed off the stage, didn't honor the pledge! I saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway. No big deal!
Arena was packed, totally electric!
I am soooo proud of my children, Don, Eric and Tiffany - their speeches, under enormous pressure, were incredible. Ivanka intros me tonight!
Ted Cruz talks about the Constitution but doesn't say that if the Dems win the Presidency, the new JUSTICES appointed will destroy us all!
Other than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses, the party is VERY united. Great love in the arena!
What a great four days in Cleveland. So proud of the great job done by the RNC and all. The police and Secret Service were fantastic!
Thank you Cleveland. We love you and will be back many times!
Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.
Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?
I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.
The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?
Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!
Pocahontas wanted V․P․ slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!
Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED
Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.
Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!
Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!
I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!
Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!
The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud!
Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!
The Crooked Hillary V․P․ choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!
Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V․P․, is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT
Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!
Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!
An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!
Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!
I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!
If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild
Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out
Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!
The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!
The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!
The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!
Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing!
The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me
How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!
Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie.
Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!
Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!
The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!
Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA
Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War.
While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.
Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V․P․ a joke!
If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.
Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.
Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!
Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.
Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great
Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch.
The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!
Bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!
Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.
In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy!
For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia.
No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!
I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!
Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?
As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.
The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!
Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!
Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!
Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic
If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI!
Shooting deaths of police officers up 78% this year. We must restore law and order and protect our great law enforcement officers!
Our country does not feel 'great already' to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair.
President Obama spoke last night about a world that doesn’t exist. 70% of the people think our country is going in the wrong direction. #DNC
A vote for Clinton-Kaine is a vote for TPP, NAFTA, high taxes, radical regulation, and massive influx of refugees.
Median household income is down for the middle class since Obama took office. It will only go further down under Clinton.
Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.
Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!
Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.
Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world.
No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.
Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and "forgot" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!
Two policemen just shot in San Diego, one dead. It is only getting worse. People want LAW AND ORDER!
Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!
General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS. His record = BAD #NeverHillary
"Little" Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!
If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town! #NeverHillary
Crooked Hillary said that I "couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign." Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her!
The dishonest media didn't mention that Bernie Sanders was very angry looking during Crooked's speech. He wishes he didn't make that deal!
Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary. She sold them out, V․P․ pick!
I am watching Crooked Hillary speak. Same old stuff, our country needs change!
Hillary Clinton should not be given national security briefings in that she is a lose cannon with extraordinarily bad judgement & insticts.
As usual, Hillary & the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games. Same as last time w/ Bernie. Unacceptable!
Colorado was amazing yesterday! So much support. Our tax, trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to Colorado and the whole country.
Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters. Her foreign wars, NAFTA/TPP support & Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes.
We are suffering through the worst long-term unemployment in the last 70 years. I want change - Crooked Hillary Clinton does not.
Just got back from Colorado. The love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible. Big crowds!
Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.
Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster!
Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two "Big Thursdays" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings
I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!
Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?
Crooked's stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with Bill, VP
The "Rust Belt" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END!
Wow, NATO's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS. This is a general I will like!
Thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the Republican National Convention #1 over Crooked Hillary and DEMS.
Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP 32.2 MILLION. CLINTON 27.8 MILLION. Thank you!
Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our "leaders" to eradicate it!
I was viciously attacked by Mr․ Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!
The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H?
Mr․ Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T․V․ doing the same - Nice!
This story is not about Mr․ Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U․S․. Get smart!
When I said in an interview that Putin is "not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down," I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea!
So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine, they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That's what I said!
CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton.
CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime, failing schools and vanishing jobs.
When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's pay-for-play at State Department?
Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?
The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs, or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life.
People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary.that's really saying something!
Hillary Clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays & refuses to speak out against Radical Islam.
When will CNN do a segment on Hillary’s plan to increase Syrian refugees 550% and how much it will cost?
Vast numbers of manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania have moved to Mexico and other countries. That will end when I win!
Great day in Virginia. Crowd was fantastic!
There is great unity in my campaign, perhaps greater than ever before. I want to thank everyone for your tremendous support. Beat Crooked H!
Our incompetent Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, was the one who started talks to give 400 million dollars, in cash, to Iran. Scandal!
President Obama should ask the DNC about how they rigged the election against Bernie.
Obama's disastrous judgment gave us ISIS, rise of Iran, and the worst economic numbers since the Great Depression!
The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!
Hillary Clinton is being badly criticized for her poor performance in answering questions. Let us all see what happens!
Crooked Hillary said loudly, and for the world to see, that she "SHORT CIRCUITED" when answering a question on her e-mails. Very dangerous!
Anybody whose mind "SHORT CIRCUITS" is not fit to be our president! Look up the word "BRAINWASHED."
Heading to New Hampshire - will be talking about Hillary saying her brain SHORT CIRCUITED, and other things!
I am not just running against Crooked Hillary Clinton, I am running against the very dishonest and totally biased media - but I will win!
I see where Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake of Baltimore is pushing Crooked hard. Look at the job she has done in Baltimore. She is a joke!
The media is going crazy. They totally distort so many things on purpose. Crimea, nuclear, "the baby" and so much more. Very dishonest!
Michael Morell, the lightweight former Acting Director of C․I․A․, and a man who has made serious bad calls, is a total Clinton flunky!
My economic policy speech will be carried live at 12:15 P․M․. Enjoy!
Many people are saying that the Iranians killed the scientist who helped the U․S․ because of Hillary Clinton's hacked emails.
I am running against the Washington insiders, just like I did in the Republican Primaries. These are the people that have made U․S․ a mess!
When is the media going to talk about Hillary's policies that have gotten people killed, like Libya, open borders, and maybe her emails?
Media desperate to distract from Clinton's anti-2A stance. I said pro-2A citizens must organize and get out vote to save our Constitution!
Morning Joe's weakness is its low ratings. I don't watch anymore but I heard he went wild against Rudy Giuliani and #2A - sad & irrelevant!
My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers shot in Sebastian County, Arkansas. #LESM
Great job today by the NYPD in protecting the people and saving the climber.
A massive tax increase will be necessary to fund Crooked Hillary Clinton's agenda. What a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday!
I love watching these poor, pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out. They can't!
ISIS gained tremendous strength during Hillary Clinton's term as Secretary of State. When will the dishonest media report the facts!
I am truly enjoying myself while running for president. The people of our country are amazing - great numbers on November 8th!
We now have confirmation as to one reason Crooked H wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - PAY-FOR-PLAY. How can she run for Pres․
If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%
My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!
I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!
It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!
I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!
"Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents!
Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U․S․Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!
They will soon be calling me MR. BREXIT!
Thank you to NC for last evenings great reception. The speech was a great success. Heading now to Louisiana & another speech tonight in MI.
Thank you to everyone for all of the nice comments, by Twitter, pundits and otherwise for my speech last night.
#WheresHillary? Sleeping!!!!!
Just leaving Virginia - really big crowd, great enthusiasm!
We will bring America together as ONE country again – united as Americans in common purpose and common dreams. #MAGA
I have been drawing very big and enthusiastic crowds, but the media refuses to show or discuss them. Something very big is happening!
Crooked Hillary is flooding the airwaves with false and misleading ads - all paid for by her bosses on Wall Street. Media is protecting her!
Just leaving Akron, Ohio, after a packed rally. Amazing people! Going now to Texas.
It is being reported by virtually everyone, and is a fact, that the media pile on against me is the worst in American political history!
Hillary Clinton strongly stated that there was "absolutely no connection" between her private work and that of The State Department. LIE!
President Obama should have gone to Louisiana days ago, instead of golfing. Too little, too late!
My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and families of those affected by two powerful earthquakes in Italy and Myanmar.
Thoughts and prayers to the great people of Indiana. You will prevail!
So many in the African-American community are doing so badly, poverty and crime way up, employment and jobs way down: I will fix it, promise
Just watched recap of #CrookedHillary's speech. Very short and lies. She is the only one fear-mongering!
Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself!
Hillary Clinton is using race-baiting to try to get African-American voters- but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION!
Hillary Clinton only knows how to make a speech when it is a hit on me. No policy, and always very short (stamina). Media gives her a pass!
Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to solve the problems of poverty, education and safety within the African-American & Hispanic communities
What do African-Americans and Hispanics have to lose by going with me. Look at the poverty, crime and educational statistics. I will fix it!
I am very proud to have brought the subject of illegal immigration back into the discussion. Such a big problem for our country-I will solve
How quickly people forget that Crooked Hillary called African-American youth "SUPER PREDATORS" - Has she apologized?
Will be in Phoenix, Arizona on Wednesday. Changing venue to much larger one. Demand is unreal. Polls looking great! #ImWithYou
Heroin overdoses are taking over our children and others in the MIDWEST. Coming in from our southern border. We need strong border & WALL!
Dwyane Wade's cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!
My condolences to Dwyane Wade and his family, on the loss of Nykea Aldridge. They are in my thoughts and prayers.
Today is the 53rd anniversary of the March on Washington - today we honor the enduring fight for justice, equality and opportunity.
I think that both candidates, Crooked Hillary and myself, should release detailed medical records. I have no problem in doing so! Hillary?
I will be making a major speech on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION on Wednesday in the GREAT State of Arizona. Big crowds, looking for a larger venue.
Look how bad it is getting! How much more crime, how many more shootings, will it take for African-Americans and Latinos to vote Trump=SAFE!
Inner-city crime is reaching record levels. African-Americans will vote for Trump because they know I will stop the slaughter going on!
Does anyone know that Crooked Hillary, who tried so hard, was unable to pass the Bar Exams in Washington D․C․. She was forced to go elsewhere
Crooked Hillary's brainpower is highly overrated.Probably why her decision making is so bad or, as stated by Bernie S, she has BAD JUDGEMENT
Now that African-Americans are seeing what a bad job Hillary type policy and management has done to the inner-cities, they want TRUMP!
From day one I said that I was going to build a great wall on the SOUTHERN BORDER, and much more. Stop illegal immigration. Watch Wednesday!
Former President Vicente Fox, who is railing against my visit to Mexico today, also invited me when he apologized for using the "f bomb."
Hillary Clinton didn't go to Louisiana, and now she didn't go to Mexico. She doesn't have the drive or stamina to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Great trip to Mexico today - wonderful leadership and high quality people! Look forward to our next meeting.
Mexico will pay for the wall!
Poll numbers way up - making big progress!
People will be very surprised by our ground game on Nov. 8. We have an army of volunteers and people with GREAT SPIRIT! They want to #MAGA!
I visited our Trump Tower campaign headquarters last night, after returning from Ohio and Arizona, and it was packed with great pros - WIN!
Crooked Hillary's V․P․ pick said this morning that I was not aware that Russia took over Crimea. A total lie - and taken over during O term!
The Great State of Arizona, where I just had a massive rally (amazing people), has a very weak and ineffective Senator, Jeff Flake. Sad!
The polls are close so Crooked Hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow.Why did she hammer 13 devices and acid-wash e-mails?
To the African-American community: The Democrats have failed you for fifty years, high crime, poor schools, no jobs. I will fix it, VOTE "T"
Lyin' Hillary Clinton told the FBI that she did not know the "C" markings on documents stood for CLASSIFIED. How can this be happening?
President Obama & Putin fail to reach deal on Syria - so what else is new? Obama is not a natural deal maker. Only makes bad deals!
The truly great Phyllis Schlafly, who honored me with her strong endorsement for president, has passed away at 92. She was very special!
China wouldn't provide a red carpet stairway from Air Force One and then Philippines President calls Obama "the son of a whore." Terrible!
As a tribute to the late, great Phyllis Schlafly, I hope everybody can go out and get her latest book, THE CONSERVATIVE CASE FOR TRUMP.
Mainstream media never covered Hillary’s massive “hacking” or coughing attack, yet it is #1 trending. What’s up?
Thank you to our fantastic veterans. The reviews and polls from almost everyone of my Commander-in-Chief presentation were great. Nice!
Wow, reviews are in - THANK YOU!
"A rough night for Hillary Clinton" ABC News.
Hillary Clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. She is totally confused. Unfit to serve as #POTUS.
Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Peña Nieto.
With Luis, Mexico and the United States would have made wonderful deals together - where both Mexico and the US would have benefitted.
It wasn't Matt Lauer that hurt Hillary last night. It was her very dumb answer about emails & the veteran who said she should be in jail.
Just returned from Pensacola, Florida, where the crowd was incredible.
Will be in Missouri today with Melania for the funeral of a wonderful and truly respected woman, Phyllis S!
Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. I think it will cost her at the Polls!
Really sad that Republicans would allow themselves to be used in a Clinton ad. Lindsey Graham, Romney, Flake, Sass. SUPREME COURT, REMEMBER!
While Hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, I still respect them all!
Hillary Clinton just had her 47% moment. What a terrible thing she said about so many great Americans!
Just got back from Asheville, North Carolina, where we had a massive rally. The spirit of the crowd was unbelievable. Thank you! #MAGA
Why isn't President Obama working instead of campaigning for Hillary Clinton?
Russia took Crimea during the so-called Obama years. Who wouldn't know this and why does Obama get a free pass?
I was never a fan of Colin Powell after his weak understanding of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq = disaster. We can do much better!
I am now going to the brand new Trump International, Hotel D․C․ for a major statement.
Just leaving Miami for Houston, Oklahoma and Colorado. Miami crowd was fantastic!
Crooked Hillary wants to take your 2nd Amendment rights away. Will guns be taken from her heavily armed Secret Service detail? Maybe not!
I never met former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. He knows nothing about me. But look at the results under his guidance - a total disaster!
Heading to Colorado for a big rally. Massive crowd, great people! Will be there soon - the polls are looking good.
Never met but never liked dopey Robert Gates. Look at the mess the U․S․ is in. Always speaks badly of his many bosses, including Obama.
I would like to express my warmest regards, best wishes and condolences to all of the families and victims of the horrible bombing in NYC.
Under the leadership of Obama & Clinton, Americans have experienced more attacks at home than victories abroad. Time to change the playbook!
Terrible attacks in NY, NJ and MN this weekend. Thinking of victims, their families and all Americans! We need to be strong!
Great job once again by law enforcement! We are proud of them and should embrace them - without them, we don't have a country!
Once again someone we were told is ok turns out to be a terrorist who wants to destroy our country & its people- how did he get thru system?
Crooked Hillary has been fighting ISIS, or whatever she has been doing, for years. Now she has new ideas. It is time for change.
Do people notice Hillary is copying my airplane rallies - she puts the plane behind her like I have been doing from the beginning.
Heading to North Carolina for two big rallies. Will be there soon. We will bring jobs back where they belong!
Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary - see you at the debate!
The situations in Tulsa and Charlotte are tragic. We must come together to make America safe again.
Hopefully the violence & unrest in Charlotte will come to an immediate end. To those injured, get well soon. We need unity & leadership.
Hillary Clinton just lost every Republican she ever had, including Never Trump, all farmers & sm. biz, by saying she’ll tax estates at 65%.
Crooked Hillary's bad judgement forced her to announce that she would go to Charlotte on Saturday to grandstand. Dem pols said no way, dumb!
If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him!
Many on the team and staff of Bernie Sanders have been treated badly by the Hillary Clinton campaign - and they like Trump on trade, a lot!
Bernie Sanders gave Hillary the Dem nomination when he gave up on the e-mails. That issue has only gotten bigger!
Looking forward to my meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu in Trump Tower at 10:00 A․M․
Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N․C․ riots!
Really sad news: The great Arnold Palmer, the "King," has died. There was no-one like him - a true champion! He will be truly missed.
Nothing on emails. Nothing on the corrupt Clinton Foundation. And nothing on #Benghazi. #Debates2016 #debatenight
I really enjoyed the debate last night.Crooked Hillary says she is going to do so many things.Why hasn't she done them in her last 30 years?
The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon - thank you!
Hillary's been failing for 30 years in not getting the job done - it will never change.
Well, now they're saying that I not only won the NBC Presidential Forum, but last night the big debate. Nice!
In the last 24 hrs. we have raised over $13M from online donations and National Call Day, and we’re still going! Thank you America! #MAGA
Every on-line poll, Time Magazine, Drudge etc., has me winning the debate. Thank you to Fox & Friends for so reporting!
My condolences to those involved in today's horrible accident in NJ and my deepest gratitude to all of the amazing first responders.
Anytime you see a story about me or my campaign saying "sources said," DO NOT believe it. There are no sources, they are just made up lies!
Wow, Crooked Hillary was duped and used by my worst Miss U․ Hillary floated her as an "angel" without checking her past, which is terrible!
Using Alicia M in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that Crooked Hillary suffers from BAD JUDGEMENT! Hillary was set up by a con.
Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U․S․ citizen so she could use her in the debate?
Remember, don't believe "sources said" by the VERY dishonest media. If they don't name the sources, the sources don't exist.
The people are really smart in cancelling subscriptions to the Dallas & Arizona papers & now USA Today will lose readers! The people get it!
For those few people knocking me for tweeting at three o'clock in the morning, at least you know I will be there, awake, to answer the call!
I won the debate if you decide without watching the totally one-sided "spin" that followed. This despite the really bad microphone.
The so-called Commission on Presidential Debates admitted to us that the DJT audio & sound level was very bad. So why didn't they fix it?
Heading to Pennsylvania for a big rally tonight. We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I have created tens of thousands of jobs and will bring back great American prosperity. Hillary has only created jobs at the FBI and DOJ!
Bernie should pull his endorsement of Crooked Hillary after she decieved him and then attacked him and his supporters.
Melania and I extend our warmest greetings to those observing Rosh Hashanah here in the United States, in Israel, and around the world.
Just announced that Iraq (U.S․) is preparing for battle to reclaim Mosul. Why do they have to announce this? Makes mission much harder!
Wow, did you just hear Bill Clinton's statement on how bad ObamaCare is. Hillary not happy. As I have been saying, REPEAL AND REPLACE!
I will be live-tweeting the V․P․. Debate. Very exciting! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Here we go - Enjoy!
Both are looking good! Now we begin!
The constant interruptions last night by Tim Kaine should not have been allowed. Mike Pence won big!
Bill Clinton is right: Obamacare is 'crazy', 'doesn't work' and 'doesn't make sense'. Thanks Bill for telling the truth.
EARLY VOTING: MN & IA already underway, more states coming up in the next week: OH, ME, AZ, IN — check w/local officials for details & VOTE!
Praying for everyone in Florida. Hoping the hurricane dissipates, but in any event, please be careful.
Certainly has been an interesting 24 hours!
The media and establishment want me out of the race so badly - I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE, WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN! #MAGA
Thank you to my great supporters in Wisconsin. I heard that the crowd and enthusiasm was unreal!
Tremendous support (except for some Republican "leadership"). Thank you.
So many self-righteous hypocrites. Watch their poll numbers - and elections - go down!
My team of deplorables will be taking over my Twitter account for tonight's #debate #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
It’s this simple. “Make America Great Again.” #debate #BigLeagueTruth
I’m not proud of my locker room talk. But this world has serious problems. We need serious leaders. #debate #BigLeagueTruth
There’s never been anyone more abusive to women in politics than Bill Clinton.My words were unfortunate-the Clintons’ actions were far worse
If I win-I am going to instruct my AG to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation bc there's never been anything like your lies.
Basically nothing Hillary has said about her secret server has been true. #CrookedHillary
Hillary’s 33,000 deleted emails about her daughter’s wedding. That’s a lot of wedding emails. #debate
We must repeal Obamacare and replace it with a much more competitive, comprehensive, affordable system. #debate #MAGA
This country cannot take four more years of Barack Obama! #Debate
Our country has the slowest growth since 1929. #BigLeagueTruth #debate
Thank you for all of the great comments on the debate last night. Very exciting!
Paul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee
Despite winning the second debate in a landslide (every poll), it is hard to do well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support!
Our very weak and ineffective leader, Paul Ryan, had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty.
With the exception of cheating Bernie out of the nom the Dems have always proven to be far more loyal to each other than the Republicans!
Disloyal R's are far more difficult than Crooked Hillary. They come at you from all sides. They don’t know how to win - I will teach them!
The very foul mouthed Sen․ John McCain begged for my support during his primary (I gave, he won), then dropped me over locker room remarks!
In Texas now, leaving soon for BIG rally in Florida!
I hope people are looking at the disgraceful behavior of Hillary Clinton as exposed by WikiLeaks. She is unfit to run.
Crooked Hillary Clinton likes to talk about the things she will do but she has been there for 30 years - why didn't she do them?
Very little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks. So dishonest! Rigged system!
The people of Cuba have struggled too long. Will reverse Obama's Executive Orders and concessions towards Cuba until freedoms are restored.
Why didn't the writer of the twelve year old article in People Magazine mention the "incident" in her story. Because it did not happen!
I am making a major speech in West Palm Beach, Florida at noon. Tune in!
Just left a great rally in Florida - now heading to Ohio for two more. Will be there soon.
Great event in Columbus- taking off for Cincinnati now. Great new Ohio poll out- thank you! OHIO NBC/WSJ/MARIST POLL Trump 42% Clinton 41%
Dem Gov․ of MN. just announced that the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is no longer affordable. I've been saying this for years- disaster!
100% fabricated and made-up charges, pushed strongly by the media and the Clinton Campaign, may poison the minds of the American Voter. FIX!
This election is being rigged by the media pushing false and unsubstantiated charges, and outright lies, in order to elect Crooked Hillary!
Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted and should be in jail. Instead she is running for president in what looks like a rigged election
Landing in New Hampshire soon to talk about the massive drug problem there, and all over the country.
Nothing ever happened with any of these women. Totally made up nonsense to steal the election. Nobody has more respect for women than me!
A great day in New Hampshire and Maine. Fantastic crowds and energy! #MAGA
Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me.Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election!
Polls close, but can you believe I lost large numbers of women voters based on made up events THAT NEVER HAPPENED. Media rigging election!
Election is being rigged by the media, in a coordinated effort with the Clinton campaign, by putting stories that never happened into news!
The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD
The Democrats have a corrupt political machine pushing crooked Hillary Clinton. We have Paul Ryan, always fighting the Republican nominee!
Paul Ryan, a man who doesn't know how to win (including failed run four years ago), must start focusing on the budget, military, vets etc.
Finally, in the new ABC News/Washington Post Poll, Hillary Clinton is down 11 points with WOMEN VOTERS and the election is close at 47-43!
Wow, interview released by Wikileakes shows "quid pro quo" in Crooked Hillary e-mail probe.Such a dishonest person - & Paul Ryan does zilch!
Can't believe these totally phoney stories, 100% made up by women (many already proven false) and pushed big time by press, have impact!
Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!
We have all got to come together and win this election. We can't have four more years of Obama (or worse!).
Voter fraud! Crooked Hillary Clinton even got the questions to a debate, and nobody says a word. Can you imagine if I got the questions?
New polls are good because the media has deceived the public by putting women front and center with made-up stories and lies, and got caught
I will sign the first bill to repeal #Obamacare and give Americans many choices and much lower rates!
I will be handing over my Twitter account to my team of deplorables for tonight's #debate #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Ready to lead. Ready to Make America Great Again. #Debate #MAGA
The 2nd Amendment is under siege. We need SCOTUS judges who will uphold the US Constitution. #Debate #BigLeagueTruth
Drugs are pouring into this country. If we have no border, we have no country. That’s why ICE endorsed me. #Debate #BigLeagueTruth
One of my first acts as President will be to deport the drug lords and then secure the border. #Debate #MAGA
Hillary is too weak to lead on border security-no solutions, no ideas, no credibility.She supported NAFTA, worst deal in US history. #Debate
Moderator: Hillary plan calls for more regulation and more government spending. #Debate #BigLeagueTruth
I will renegotiate NAFTA. If I can’t make a great deal, we’re going to tear it up. We’re going to get this economy running again. #Debate
Our country is stagnant. We’ve lost jobs and business. We don’t make things anymore b/c of the bill Hillary’s husband signed and she blessed
Moderator: “Respectfully, you won’t answer the pay-to-play question.” #Debate #BigLeagueTruth
Bernie Sanders on HRC: Bad Judgement. John Podesta on HRC: Bad Instincts. #BigLeagueTruth #Debate
USA has the greatest business people in the world but we let political hacks negotiate our deals. We need change! #BigLeagueTruth #Debate
I started this campaign to Make America Great Again. That’s what I’m going to do. #MAGA #debate
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama and that’s what you’ll get if you vote for Hillary. #BigLeagueTruth
That was really exciting. Made all of my points. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Why didn't Hillary Clinton announce that she was inappropriately given the debate questions - she secretly used them! Crooked Hillary.
The results are in on the final debate and it is almost unanimous, I WON! Thank you, these are very exciting times.
Just returned from Pennsylvania where we will be bringing back their jobs. Amazing crowd. Will be going back tomorrow, to Gettysburg!
The media refuses to talk about the three new national polls that have me in first place. Biggest crowds ever - watch what happens!
"If you can't run your own house you certainly can't run the White House" A statement made by Mrs․ Obama about Crooked Hillary Clinton
Well, Iran has done it again. Taken two of our people and asking for a fortune for their release. This doesn't happen if I'm president!
The attack on Mosul is turning out to be a total disaster. We gave them months of notice. U․S․ is looking so dumb. VOTE TRUMP and WIN AGAIN!
Wow, just came out on secret tape that Crooked Hillary wants to take in as many Syrians as possible. We cannot let this happen - ISIS!
Major story that the Dems are making up phony polls in order to suppress the the Trump . We are going to WIN!
Why has nobody asked Kaine about the horrible views emanated on WikiLeaks about Catholics? Media in the tank for Clinton but Trump will win!
We are winning and the press is refusing to report it. Don't let them fool you- get out and vote! #DrainTheSwamp on November 8th!
Obamacare is a disaster. Rates going through the sky - ready to explode. I will fix it. Hillary can't! #ObamacareFailed
REPEAL AND REPLACE!!! #ObamaCareInThreeWords
REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE!
A lot of call-ins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas. People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on?
If my people said the things about me that Podesta & Hillary's people said about her, I would fire them out of self respect. "Bad instincts"
Heading to New Hampshire. Will be talking about the disaster known as ObamaCare!
Just out: Neera Tanden, Hillary Clinton adviser said, “Israel is depressing.” I think Israel is inspiring!
Just landed in Iowa - speaking soon!
I am in Colorado - big day planned - but nothing can be as big as yesterday!
We are now leading in many polls, and many of these were taken before the criminal investigation announcement on Friday - great in states!
Hillary and the Dems loved and praised FBI Director Comey just a few days ago. Original evidence was overwhelming, should not have delayed!
Wow, Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media!
Look at the way Crooked Hillary is handling the e-mail case and the total mess she is in. She is unfit to be president. Bad judgement!
Crooked Hillary should not be allowed to run for president. She deleted 33,000 e-mails AFTER getting a subpoena from U․S․. Congress. RIGGED!
So terrible that Crooked didn't report she got the debate questions from Donna Brazile, if that were me it would have been front page news!
You can change your vote in six states. So, now that you see that Hillary was a big mistake, change your vote to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I am going to repeal and replace ObamaCare. We will have MUCH less expensive and MUCH better healthcare. With Hillary, costs will triple!
Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 e-mails AFTER they were subpoenaed by the United States Congress. Guilty - cannot run. Rigged system!
Praying for the families of the two Iowa police who were ambushed this morning. An attack on those who keep us safe is an attack on us all.
My wife, Melania, will be speaking in Pennsylvania this afternoon. So exciting, big crowds! I will be watching from North Carolina.
ObamaCare is a total disaster. Hillary Clinton wants to save it by making it even more expensive. Doesn't work, I will REPEAL AND REPLACE!
If Obama worked as hard on straightening out our country as he has trying to protect and elect Hillary, we would all be much better off!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Big news to share in New Hampshire tonight! Polls looking great! See you soon.
TODAY WE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I will be watching the election results from Trump Tower in Manhattan with my family and friends. Very exciting!
Don't let up, keep getting out to vote - this election is FAR FROM OVER! We are doing well but there is much time left. GO FLORIDA!
Such a beautiful and important evening! The forgotten man and woman will never be forgotten again. We will all come together as never before
A fantastic day in D․C․. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs․ O a lot!
Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!
Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!
Busy day planned in New York. Will soon be making some very important decisions on the people who will be running our government!
This will prove to be a great time in the lives of ALL Americans. We will unite and we will win, win, win!
Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win. Very nice!
Jeb Bush, George W and George H․W․ all called to express their best wishes on the win. Very nice!
Governor John Kasich of the GREAT, GREAT, GREAT State of Ohio called to congratulate me on the win. The people of Ohio were incredible!
The debates, especially the second and third, plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies, plus OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS, gave us the win!
If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in N․Y․. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily
The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different!
Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!
I am not trying to get "top level security clearance" for my children. This was a typically false news story.
My transition team, which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job, will be seeing many great candidates today. #MAGA
Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico
I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!
I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country.
The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U․ Too bad!
Our wonderful future V․P․. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen!
The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!
The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior
Numerous patriots will be coming to Bedminster today as I continue to fill out the various positions necessary to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
General James "Mad Dog" Mattis, who is being considered for Secretary of Defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true General's General!
I have always had a good relationship with Chuck Schumer. He is far smarter than Harry R and has the ability to get things done. Good news!
Prior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world.Only the crooked media makes this a big deal!
Great meetings will take place today at Trump Tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next 8 years.
I am seriously considering Dr․ Ben Carson as the head of HUD. I've gotten to know him well--he's a greatly talented person who loves people!
Bus crash in Tennessee so sad & so terrible. Condolences to all family members and loved ones. These beautiful children will be remembered!
Happy Thanksgiving to everyone. We will, together, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A․C․. Company to stay in the U․S․ (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon!
Fidel Castro is dead!
The Green Party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated & demoralized Dems
The Democrats, when they incorrectly thought they were going to win, asked that the election night tabulation be accepted. Not so anymore!
Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change
Hillary's debate answer on delay: "That is horrifying. That is not the way our democracy works. Been around for 240 years. We've had free --
and fair elections. We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them, and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a -
during a general election. I, for one, am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind --
of position." Then, separately she stated, "He said something truly horrifying . he refused to say that he would respect the results of --
this election. That is a direct threat to our democracy." She then said, "We have to accept the results and look to the future, Donald --
Trump is going to be our President. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead." So much time and money will be spent - same result! Sad
In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally
It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4--
states instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!
Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem!
If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U․S․ as a whole, I will terminate deal.
Just met with General Petraeus--was very impressed!
The Great State of Michigan was just certified as a Trump WIN giving all of our MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN supporters another victory - 306!
Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag - if they do, there must be consequences - perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!
My thoughts and prayers are with the great people of Tennessee during these terrible wildfires. Stay safe!
I will be going to Indiana on Thursday to make a major announcement concerning Carrier A․C․ staying in Indianapolis. Great deal for workers!
Big day on Thursday for Indiana and the great workers of that wonderful state.We will keep our companies and jobs in the U․S․. Thanks Carrier
ISIS is taking credit for the terrible stabbing attack at Ohio State University by a Somali refugee who should not have been in our country.
I will be holding a major news conference in New York City with my children on December 15 to discuss the fact that I will be leaving my .
great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! While I am not mandated to .
do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses.
Hence, legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations. The Presidency is a far more important task!
Look forward to going to Indiana tomorrow in order to be with the great workers of Carrier. They will sell many air conditioners!
My thoughts and prayers are with those affected by the tragic storms and tornadoes in the Southeastern United States. Stay safe!
Getting ready to leave for the Great State of Indiana and meet the hard working and wonderful people of Carrier A․C․
The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!
Interesting how the U․S․ sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.
Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!
State Treasurer John Kennedy is my choice for US Senator from Louisiana. Early voting today; election next Saturday.
Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad
The U․S․ is going to substantialy reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country,
fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U․S․ without retribution or consequence, is WRONG! There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies wanting to sell their product, cars, A․C․ units etc., back across the border. This tax will make leaving financially difficult, but.
these companies are able to move between all 50 states, with no tax or tariff being charged. Please be forewarned prior to making a very .
expensive mistake! THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS
The Green Party just dropped its recount suit in Pennsylvania and is losing votes in Wisconsin recount. Just a Stein scam to raise money!
Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into.
their country (the U․S․ doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea? I don't think so!
If the press would cover me accurately & honorably, I would have far less reason to "tweet." Sadly, I don't know if that will ever happen!
Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!
Masa (SoftBank) of Japan has agreed to invest $50 billion in the U․S․ toward businesses and 50,000 new jobs.
Masa said he would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!
Chuck Jones, who is President of United Steelworkers 1999, has done a terrible job representing workers. No wonder companies flee country!
If United Steelworkers 1999 was any good, they would have kept those jobs in Indiana. Spend more time working-less time talking. Reduce dues
Today we lost a great pioneer of air and space in John Glenn. He was a hero and inspired generations of future explorers. He will be missed.
I have NOTHING to do with The Apprentice except for fact that I conceived it with Mark B & have a big stake in it. Will devote ZERO TIME!
As a show of support for our Armed Forces, I will be going to The Army-Navy Game today. Looking forward to it, should be fun!
Being at the Army - Navy Game was fantastic. There is nothing like the spirit in that stadium. A wonderful experience, and congrats to Army!
I spent Friday campaigning with John Kennedy, of the Great State of Louisiana, for the U․S․Senate. The election is over - JOHN WON!
Whether I choose him or not for "State"- Rex Tillerson, the Chairman & CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker. Stay tuned!
Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory!
Unless you catch "hackers" in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn't this brought up before election?
The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.
The final Wisconsin vote is in and guess what - we just picked up an additional 131 votes. The Dems and Green Party can now rest. Scam!
I will be making my announcement on the next Secretary of State tomorrow morning.
Even though I am not mandated by law to do so, I will be leaving my busineses before January 20th so that I can focus full time on the Presidency. Two of my children, Don and Eric, plus executives, will manage them. No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office.
I will hold a press conference in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest. Busy times!
I have chosen one of the truly great business leaders of the world, Rex Tillerson, Chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil, to be Secretary of State.
Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have just certified my wins in those states. I actually picked up additional votes!
The thing I like best about Rex Tillerson is that he has vast experience at dealing successfully with all types of foreign governments.
Thank you to Time Magazine and Financial Times for naming me "Person of the Year" - a great honor!
The media tries so hard to make my move to the White House, as it pertains to my business, so complex - when actually it isn't!
If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?
Are we talking about the same cyberattack where it was revealed that head of the DNC illegally gave Hillary the questions to the debate?
Well, we all did it, together! I hope the "MOVEMENT" fans will go to D․C․ on Jan 20th for the swearing in. Let's set the all time record!
Last night in Orlando, Florida, was incredible - massive crowd - THANK YOU FLORIDA! Today at 3:00 P․M․. I will be in Alabama for last rally!
Mobile, Alabama today at 3:00 P․M․. Last rally of the year - "THANK YOU ALABAMA AND THE SOUTH" Biggest of all crowds expected, see you there!
China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters - rips it out of water and takes it to China in unprecedented act.
We should tell China that we don't want the drone they stole back.- let them keep it!
If my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing, they would be scorned & called terrible names!
Today there were terror attacks in Turkey, Switzerland and Germany - and it is only getting worse. The civilized world must change thinking!
We did it! Thank you to all of my great supporters, we just officially won the election (despite all of the distorted and inaccurate media).
Bill Clinton stated that I called him after the election. Wrong, he called me (with a very nice congratulations). He "doesn't know much" .
especially how to get people, even with an unlimited budget, out to vote in the vital swing states ( and more). They focused on wrong states
Yes, it is true - Carlos Slim, the great businessman from Mexico, called me about getting together for a meeting. We met, HE IS A GREAT GUY!
Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult & sophisticated than the popular vote. Hillary focused on the wrong states!
I would have done even better in the election, if that is possible, if the winner was based on popular vote - but would campaign differently
I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss!
I met some really great Air Force GENERALS and Navy ADMIRALS today, talking about airplane capability and pricing. Very impressive people!
Someone incorrectly stated that the phrase "DRAIN THE SWAMP" was no longer being used by me. Actually, we will always be trying to DTS.
The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes
Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!
The so-called "A" list celebrities are all wanting tixs to the inauguration, but look what they did for Hillary, NOTHING. I want the PEOPLE!
My wonderful son, Eric, will no longer be allowed to raise money for children with cancer because of a possible conflict of interest with.
my presidency. Isn't this a ridiculous shame? He loves these kids, has raised millions of dollars for them, and now must stop. Wrong answer!
As to the U․N․, things will be different after Jan. 20th.
The terrorist who killed so many people in Germany said just before crime, "by God's will we will slaughter you pigs, I swear, we will slaughter you. This is a purely religious threat, which turned into reality. Such hatred! When will the U․S․, and all countries, fight back?
Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: "In my opinion, it is humiliating. One must be able to lose with dignity." So true!
The big loss yesterday for Israel in the United Nations will make it much harder to negotiate peace.Too bad, but we will get it done anyway!
Merry Christmas and a very, very, very , very Happy New Year to everyone!
President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY! - jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc.
The United Nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. So sad!
The world was gloomy before I won - there was no hope. Now the market is up nearly 10% and Christmas spending is over a trillion dollars!
I gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation, raised or recieved millions more, ALL of which is given to charity, and media won't report!
The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses. 100% of money goes to wonderful charities!
President Obama campaigned hard (and personally) in the very important swing states, and lost.The voters wanted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The U․S․. Consumer Confidence Index for December surged nearly four points to 113.7, THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN MORE THAN 15 YEARS! Thanks Donald!
Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks.Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT!
We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U․S․, but not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (U.N․)! Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!
Great move on delay (by V․ Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!
Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do. Love!
Chicago murder rate is record setting - 4,331 shooting victims with 762 murders in 2016. If Mayor can't do it he must ask for Federal help!
Various media outlets and pundits say that I thought I was going to lose the election. Wrong, it all came together in the last week and.
I thought and felt I would win big, easily over the fabled 270 (306). When they cancelled fireworks, they knew, and so did I․
North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U․S․. It won't happen!
China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U․S․ in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice!
General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U․S․ car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U․S․A․or pay big border tax!
People must remember that ObamaCare just doesn't work, and it is not affordable - 116% increases (Arizona). Bill Clinton called it "CRAZY"
The Democrat Governor.of Minnesota said "The Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) is no longer affordable!" - And, it is lousy healthcare.
With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it
…may be, their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance! #DTS
There should be no further releases from Gitmo. These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield.
I will be having a general news conference on JANUARY ELEVENTH in N․Y․C․. Thank you.
The "Intelligence" briefing on so-called "Russian hacking" was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!
Julian Assange said "a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta" - why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!
Thank you to Ford for scrapping a new plant in Mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the U․S․. This is just the beginning - much more to follow
Somebody hacked the DNC but why did they not have "hacking defense" like the RNC has and why have they not responded to the terrible things they did and said (like giving the questions to the debate to H). A total double standard! Media, as usual, gave them a pass.
Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster, with its poor coverage and massive premium increases like the 116% hike in Arizona. Also, deductibles are so high that it is practically useless. Don't let the Schumer clowns out of this web.
massive increases of ObamaCare will take place this year and Dems are to blame for the mess. It will fall of its own weight - be careful!
Jackie Evancho's album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her Inauguration performance.Some people just don't understand the "Movement"
The Democrats, lead by head clown Chuck Schumer, know how bad ObamaCare is and what a mess they are in. Instead of working to fix it, they.
.do the typical political thing and BLAME. The fact is ObamaCare was a lie from the beginning."Keep you doctor, keep your plan!" It is.
.time for Republicans & Democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works - much less expensive & FAR BETTER!
The dishonest media likes saying that I am in Agreement with Julian Assange - wrong. I simply state what he states, it is for the people.
to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against "Intelligence" when in fact I am a big fan!
Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U․S․. NO WAY! Build plant in U․S․ or pay big border tax.
How did NBC get "an exclusive look into the top secret report he (Obama) was presented?" Who gave them this report and why? Politics!
The Democratic National Committee would not allow the FBI to study or see its computer info after it was supposedly hacked by Russia So how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers? What is going on?
The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!
Hillary and the Dems were never going to beat the PASSION of my voters. They saw what was happening in the last two weeks before the and knew they were in big trouble - which is why they cancelled their big fireworks at the last minute.THEY SAW A MOVEMENT LIKE NEVER BEFORE
Hopefully, all supporters, and those who want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will go to D․C․ on January 20th. It will be a GREAT SHOW!
Wow, the ratings are in and Arnold Schwarzenegger got "swamped" (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine, DJT. So much for.
being a movie star-and that was season 1 compared to season 14. Now compare him to my season 1. But who cares, he supported Kasich & Hillary
Anna Wintour came to my office at Trump Tower to ask me to meet with the editors of Conde Nast & Steven Newhouse, a friend. Will go this AM.
I am asking the chairs of the House and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it.
Monitoring the terrible situation in Florida. Just spoke to Governor Scott. Thoughts and prayers for all. Stay safe!
Gross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place.The Republican National Committee had strong defense!
Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results. Voting machines not touched!
Only reason the hacking of the poorly defended DNC is discussed is that the loss by the Dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed!
Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. Only "stupid" people, or fools, would think that it is bad! We.
have enough problems around the world without yet another one. When I am President, Russia will respect us far more than they do now and.
both countries will, perhaps, work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD!
Congratulation to Jane Timken on her major upset victory in becoming the Ohio Republican Party Chair. Jane is a loyal Trump supporter & star
I look very much forward to meeting Prime Minister Theresa May in Washington in the Spring. Britain, a longtime U․S․ ally, is very special!
Dishonest media says Mexico won't be paying for the wall if they pay a little later so the wall can be built more quickly. Media is fake!
Rupert Murdoch is a great guy who likes me much better as a very successful candidate than he ever did as a very successful developer!
Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn't know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes. She is a.
Hillary flunky who lost big. For the 100th time, I never "mocked" a disabled reporter (would never do that) but simply showed him "groveling" when he totally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad. Just more very dishonest media!
It's finally happening - Fiat Chrysler just announced plans to invest $1BILLION in Michigan and Ohio plants, adding 2000 jobs. This after.
Ford said last week that it will expand in Michigan and U․S․ instead of building a BILLION dollar plant in Mexico. Thank you Ford & Fiat C!
FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!
Russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is "A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE." Very unfair!
Russia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!
I win an election easily, a great "movement" is verified, and crooked opponents try to belittle our victory with FAKE NEWS. A sorry state!
Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to "leak" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany?
We had a great News Conference at Trump Tower today. A couple of FAKE NEWS organizations were there but the people truly get what's going on
James Clapper called me yesterday to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated. Made up, phony facts.Too bad!
Congrats to the Senate for taking the first step to #RepealObamacare- now it's onto the House!
All of my Cabinet nominee are looking good and doing a great job. I want them to be themselves and express their own thoughts, not mine!
It now turns out that the phony allegations against me were put together by my political opponents and a failed spy afraid of being sued.
Totally made up facts by sleazebag political operatives, both Democrats and Republicans - FAKE NEWS! Russia says nothing exists. Probably.
released by "Intelligence" even knowing there is no proof, and never will be. My people will have a full report on hacking within 90 days!
What are Hillary Clinton's people complaining about with respect to the F․B․I․. Based on the information they had she should never.
have been allowed to run - guilty as hell. They were VERY nice to her. She lost because she campaigned in the wrong states - no enthusiasm!
The "Unaffordable" Care Act will soon be history!
A beautiful funeral today for a real NYC hero, Detective Steven McDonald. Our law enforcement community has my complete and total support.
Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad!
Congressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U․S․. I can use all the help I can get!
Inauguration Day is turning out to be even bigger than expected. January 20th, Washington D․C․. Have fun!
The Democrats are most angry that so many Obama Democrats voted for me. With all of the jobs I am bringing back to our Nation, that number.
will only get higher. Car companies and others, if they want to do business in our country, have to start making things here again. WIN!
For many years our country has been divided, angry and untrusting. Many say it will never change, the hatred is too deep. IT WILL CHANGE!!!!
Thank you to Bob Woodward who said, "That is a garbage document.it never should have been presented.Trump's right to be upset (angry).
about that.Those Intelligence chiefs made a mistake here, & when people make mistakes, they should APOLOGIZE." Media should also apologize
much worse - just look at Syria (red line), Crimea, Ukraine and the build-up of Russian nukes. Not good! Was this the leaker of Fake News?
Celebrate Martin Luther King Day and all of the many wonderful things that he stood for. Honor him for being the great man that he was!
People are pouring into Washington in record numbers. Bikers for Trump are on their way. It will be a great Thursday, Friday and Saturday!
The same people who did the phony election polls, and were so wrong, are now doing approval rating polls. They are rigged just like before.
With all of the jobs I am bringing back into the U․S․ (even before taking office), with all of the new auto plants coming back into our.
country and with the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases and more, I believe the people are seeing "big stuff."
John Lewis said about my inauguration, "It will be the first one that I've missed." WRONG (or lie)! He boycotted Bush 43 also because he.
"thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush's swearing-in.he doesn't believe Bush is the true elected president." Sound familiar! WP
Thank you to General Motors and Walmart for starting the big jobs push back into the U․S․!
to the U․S․, but had nothing to do with TRUMP, is more FAKE NEWS. Ask top CEO's of those companies for real facts. Came back because of me!
Looking forward to a speedy recovery for George and Barbara Bush, both hospitalized. Thank you for your wonderful letter!
"It wasn't Donald Trump that divided this country, this country has been divided for a long time!" Stated today by Reverend Franklin Graham.
Getting ready to leave for Washington, D․C․. The journey begins and I will be working and fighting very hard to make it a great journey for.
the American people. I have no doubt that we will, together, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Great Concert at 4:00 P․M․ today at Lincoln Memorial. Enjoy!
It all begins today! I will see you at 11:00 A․M․ for the swearing-in. THE MOVEMENT CONTINUES - THE WORK BEGINS!
Today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another – but we are transferring.
power from Washington, D․C․ and giving it back to you, the American People. #InaugurationDay
What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.
January 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.
The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. From this moment on, it’s going to be #AmericaFirst🇺🇸
We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth - and we will bring back our dreams!
We will follow two simple rules: BUY AMERICAN & HIRE AMERICAN! #InaugurationDay #MAGA🇺🇸
Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn't these people vote? Celebs hurt cause badly.
Wow, television ratings just out: 31 million people watched the Inauguration, 11 million more than the very good ratings from 4 years ago!
Peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy. Even if I don't always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views.
Busy week planned with a heavy focus on jobs and national security. Top executives coming in at 9:00 A․M․ to talk manufacturing in America.
Will be meeting at 9:00 with top automobile executives concerning jobs in America. I want new plants to be built here for cars sold here!
If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible "carnage" going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!
Big day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow. Among many other things, we will build the wall!
