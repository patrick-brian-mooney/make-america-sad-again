This script produces the content for <a rel="me muse" href="https://twitter.com/false_trump">the @false_trump Twitter account</a>. This account contains randomly generated text produced by <a rel="me" href="https://github.com/patrick-brian-mooney/make-america-sad-again/blob/master/LICENSE.md">a Markov chain-based text generator</a> trained on the actual tweets of Donald Trump (i.e., on the Twitter account <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</a>) and his staff of jackbooted goons (er ... talented, ambitious, and spectacularly brilliant staff, each member of whom, it is clear, is highly respected by the man at the top).
